## Implementation of Machine Learning (Simple Linear Regression) in Octave/MATLAB to predict profits made by a food truck in a city
 Suppose you are the CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
profits and populations from the cities.

This is my solution to the Linear regression problem in the Machine Learning by Stanford Course taught by Prof Andrew Ng
